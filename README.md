# Text-to-list-string-converter-for-python

If you ever need to convert a long text or lots of numbers to a list string, to use as a dataset, you might need a tool like this one I wrote because I needed it. Feel free to modify the code and use it however you want it :D

# Usage
The way this works is simple. You need to start by naming your string, then providing the input text. I didn't include any checks for valid strings as I suppose a Python programmer knows how to name a string properly (for starters I linked a tutorial below).

The result will be generated in the same directory where you placed the script. It will be the same name as your string, with a .txt extension. The reason I made it like this, is because if you generate a huge list string, it is harder to copy and paste it from a terminal.
